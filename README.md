# NinjaSubs
A webapp for schools to find substitute teachers.

Created with React, MaterialUI and Firebase Cloud Firestore. 

Here is  the test server.

I have allowed access to unverified user to edit profiles, create chatrooms, create job posts and also apply to job posts.

Once testing is complete, Firebase security rules will lock all access to the main features of the app. After that email verification will be needed to use the mainfeatures.
